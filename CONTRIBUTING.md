## Testing

If you want to develop on Berglas, you will need to create a test setup.

1. Create a dedicated Google Cloud project in which to run the tests. No other
infrastructure or services should run in this project.

    ```text
    gcloud projects create ${PROJECT_ID}
    ```

1. Enable the necessary APIs on the project:

    ```text
    gcloud services enable --project ${PROJECT_ID} \
        cloudkms.googleapis.com \
        storage-api.googleapis.com \
        storage-component.googleapis.com
    ```

1. Create a Cloud Storage bucket:

    ```text
    gsutil mb -p ${PROJECT_ID} gs://${BUCKET_ID}
    gsutil versioning set on gs://${BUCKET_ID}
    ```

1. Create a Cloud KMS key:

    ```text
    gcloud kms keyrings create my-keyring \
        --project ${PROJECT_ID} \
        --location global

    gcloud kms keys create my-key \
        --project ${PROJECT_ID} \
        --location global \
        --keyring my-keyring \
        --purpose encryption
    ```

1. Export the values as environment variables:

    ```text
    export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=${PROJECT_ID}
    export GOOGLE_CLOUD_BUCKET=${BUCKET_ID}
    export GOOGLE_CLOUD_KMS_KEY=projects/${PROJECT_ID}/locations/global/keyRings/my-keyring/cryptoKeys/my-key
    export GOOGLE_CLOUD_SERVICE_ACCOUNT=${SERVICE_ACCOUNT}
    ```

1. Run tests:

    ```text
    make test-acc
    ```
